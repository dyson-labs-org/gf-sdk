## What you will accomplish

- Find the right entry point for your integration.
- Learn the core mental model and vocabulary.
- Complete a no-terminal quickstart that reaches a capability call.

## Prerequisites

- A browser IDE (CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, or Replit).
- A SCRAP Portal base URL if you want to run against a real portal.
- Production uses baseUrl `https://btcpay.dyson-labs.com` with apiPrefix `/portal`.
- The SCRAP Portal runs on a remote VPS only (170.75.173.239). Local portal execution is not supported.
- `/portal-staging` is not currently exposed; staging is TBD unless explicitly provided.
